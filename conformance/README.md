# @absolutejs/agent-conformance

Provider-neutral adversarial test runners for AI agent security boundaries.
Adapters expose a tiny harness; the package attacks it with replay, concurrent
maximum-use races, confused-deputy identity, scope escalation, lookalike URL
origins, mutated approved inputs, denied lease issuance, failed-execution
replay, and task-owner isolation.

```ts
import {
  assertConformance,
  runCapabilityConformance,
} from "@absolutejs/agent-conformance";

const report = await runCapabilityConformance(() => yourHarness());
assertConformance(report); // throws with the complete report when any case fails
```

The runners return data rather than depending on a test framework, so they work
inside Bun test, Vitest, Jest, CI scripts, or provider certification jobs.

The effect-adapter suites separately prove global certification,
descriptor-driven reconciliation setup, tenant-scoped installation, and
execution-time behavior. The execution suite verifies that
authorization happens before secret resolution, only installed aliases are
resolved, tenant/effect/destination/idempotency context reaches the driver,
driver capabilities match the certified descriptor, and unknown provider
outcomes enter durable quarantine.

The effect-evidence suite verifies that provider signatures are checked before
persistence, duplicate deliveries remain single-copy while reconciliation can
resume after a crash, retained delivery identities cannot be rebound across
effects or tenants, and only normalized evidence crosses the durable boundary.

The reconciliation-runtime suite proves that scheduled provider queries
authorize before resolving credentials, use a cross-replica lease, retain only
normalized evidence, reduce failures to safe health codes, and keep an
operator-triggered tenant run from querying another tenant's effects. It also
proves that reference-gated queries stop before credential resolution when no
exact provider resource is retained and that stale attempts cannot quarantine
a newer lease.

Version 0.3 adds discovery signature/search, durable runtime recovery/budget,
provenance/taint, scoped memory, and verified inbox suites. Passing reports can
be combined into a deterministic, optionally signed
`absolutejs-agent-first-1` certification artifact and linked from an agent's
public discovery descriptor.

Version 0.4 adds provider-neutral conformance harnesses for A2A 1.0, MCP
2025-11-25, Arazzo 1.1, and the July 2026 WebMCP draft. They test protocol
negotiation, task/session isolation, required extensions, unsafe callback URLs,
dependency ordering, policy-before-effect, unsupported-feature atomicity,
input validation, metadata poisoning, cross-origin exposure, and abort cleanup.

```ts
import {
  runA2aConformance,
  runArazzoConformance,
  runMcpConformance,
  runWebMcpConformance,
} from "@absolutejs/agent-conformance";
```

Implement only the harnesses relevant to your package:

- `ActionConformanceHarness` for approval binding and execution leases.
- `CapabilityConformanceHarness` for credential grants, delegations, spend
  mandates, or other bounded capabilities.
- `TaskConformanceHarness` for durable task ownership and cancellation.
